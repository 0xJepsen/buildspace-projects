You made it! Welcome :).

My name is Farza and I'll be your instructor. If you ever need any help, just head to #course-chat in Discord which you get access to once you connect your Discord. That's where all your fellow classmates will be so don't forget to join that!

If you **don't** have access to #course-chat and already linked your Discord, join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/mXDqs6Ubcc), and @farza in #general I'll help you get access to the right channels!

**üöÄ This is going to be awesome**
----------------------------------

I'm really excited to show you how to go from zero -> shipping your own web3 app + Ethereum smart contract.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow classmates will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand the best way to learn it.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

üè† How is this all structured?
------------------------------

This is a 1-week project.

After that, I'll be hosting around 12 virtual co-working sessions of which I recommend you attend at least 3 or 4 of them!

Basically, co-working sessions at buildspace are specific times for you to work on your project for 1-hour. It's pretty cool. Everyone joins the #cowork-sesh voice channel at a scheduled time (all muted by default), works individually on their projects, and chills with their classmates in a virtual space.

During the session, you'll also be able to ask questions in #cowork-sesh-chat and I'll be there answering them. Again, everyone's muted. We just talk in text-chat so people can focus! :)

Don't see a time that works for you? Ping me in #course-chat @farza.

üõ† What will you be building?
-----------------------------

You'll be building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a üëã + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write from, we'll talk about this more in a bit).

You'll be writing + deploying the smart contract and you'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.

We're going to make this a little spicy as well. Basically, when someone waves at you there is a random chance they can win a small amount of Ethereum from your site :).

You'll be able to customize the website as much as you want. For example:
- Maybe instead of a üëã you want people to send you a üí©.
- Perhaps instead of a plain old message, you want them to send you a Spotify link and create a place where anyone can send you awesome music and have it saved.
- You can change the smart contract to recognize when one of your friends is waving at you (based on their Ethereum wallet address) and then take them to a page where they get Rick Roll'd.

You can do whatever you want :).

By the end, you'll have a site you can show off and actually have people use. Your fellow classmates will be your first users!

ü§î Pre-Reqs
-----------

For this course, all you need to know is:

1\. How to use a terminal.\
2\. How to write/run code in at least one langauge (ex. Python, JS, C, Java, etc).\
3\. (Bonus) How to build a basic site in React.

That's it :). The rest you'll figure out along the way.

üì∫ Where does the Live Kick-Off Happen?
---------------------------------------

They'll be happening at <https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace>. Be sure to make an account on Twitch ahead of time so you'll be able to chat during the stream!

üö® Optional moment to chat w/ the community!
--------------------------------------------

Let us know in #course-chat why you're hyped about web3 and crypto! Or, what do you hope to achieve with this project :)? Or, what do you hope to learn? Would love to hear from you.
