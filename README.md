## üìö Projects

At [_buildspace](https://buildspace.so) we take a lot of time to write projects that make sense and are just straight up fun! Just like software, we are bound to make some mistakes, but thats where you come in.

We made all these lessons Open Source so you can help make our projects even better and help others conquer the decentralized web ü§ò.
